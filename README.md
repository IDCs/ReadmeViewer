# Readme Viewer Extension

Vortex extension which adds a text area to the mod detail panel; this will allow the user to view the mod's readme file (if it exists) within the Vortex application.

The readme file attribute will only set while mod installation actions are executing; keep in mind that mods which have been installed prior to integrating this extension will not have their readme field updated (this was done intentionally given the requirements, but it is easily fixable).

Tested with Morrowind mods using Vortex 0.14.3
